        <p>Welcome to Wind Turbine </p>

<p>The Wind Turbine basically operates as, the wind turbine spin and catches wind energy which led the rod and the two gears to spin. As the gear moves, it gives motion to the motor which light up the LED. The circuit board has 8 diodes which only allow the electrons to flow in one direction and create a full rectification and allow the LED (Light-Emitting diodes) to light up. The two capacitors allow AC (alternating current) to be transfers into DC (direct currents) and to store energy. Motor is connected to the circuit board by four different wires soldered to a male header pin.</p>

<p>I choose this project because renewable energy sources, such as: wind, solar energy, geothermal power and biomass crops, are necessary to eliminate our dependency on fossil fuels and to prevent extreme global change. In addition, solar collectors capture power only when the sun shines, but wind power is available 24 hours a day; therefore, I choose to use wind energy and build a vertical turbine that can light up a LED.</p>

<p>Build of Materials</p>

<p>Electronic Parts: 
1.  Stepper Motor 
2.  Breadboard 
3.  Eight Diodes
4.  One or more LED 
5.  Two1,000 μF capacitors
6.  Jumper Wires 
7.  PC board 
8.  Male header pins 
9.  Female header pins </p>

<p>Mechanical Parts 
1.  ¼ in acrylic plastic sheet about 15 × 30 in or equivalent for two gears, disks, and sail holder pieces.<br>
2.  10 in wide aluminum flash
3.  One 5mm bore shaft collar with set screw.
4.  Seven ½  in bore shaft collars with set screws
5.  18 in length of ½  in outer diameter aluminum tube 
6.  Two flanged sleeve bearing 
7.  Trust bearing case of ½ outer diameter and two matching washer 
8.  One male header pin
9.  Six socket head cap screws, 1/4 in -20 thread, 3/4 in length
10. Six lock washers for 1/4 in screw size 
11.  Six flat washers for 1/4 in screw size
12.  Four M3 screws 40mm long 
13.  Four M3 lock washers 
14.  Four M3 washers 
15.  Set of inch and metric hex keys
16.  6mm machine screw </p>

<pre><code> Step to follow
</code></pre>

<p>•  Step one: Order the leaser cut parts, two gears, two disks, and sail holders, at least three weeks before you start your project.</p>

<p>• Step two: Put on your safety glasses and cut an 18 in length of the aluminum rod with a hacksaw. Use sand paper on the inside and outside of the end of the rod to smooth it and avoid cutting yourself. </p>

<p>• Step three: Begin assembling the base. First start with the bottom disk, the hex standoffs, and the ¼ -20 screws, lock washers, and washers. Hold one hex standoff and place a washer then place the disk, another washer then a lock washer and finally put in the hex screw and tightened it with the hex key. Follow the same step to install all three of the hex standoffs. </p>

<p>• Step four: Next place the flanged sleeve bearing, thrust washer, thrust bearing, another washer, and shaft collar on the center of the bottom disk. Next Slide the aluminum rod through the ½ shaft collar, thrust washer, bearing, washer stack. </p>

<p>• Step five: Take the gear with bigger hole and apply glue to the ½ shaft collar and the gear to hold together. Next do the same with other gear but use the 5mm shaft collar instead of the ½ shaft collar. Wait 10 minutes to let it dry. 
• Step six: slide the ½ shaft collar with the gear and for now put aside the other gear. Next, slide another shaft collar and rest a sleeve bearing.</p>

<p>• Step seven: Now remove the screws that hold the motor together. Use the longer M3 screws to mount the motor from the back, on the underside of the top disk. Next slide the top disk into the rod and repeat step three. </p>

<p>• Step eight: slide the other gear from step five and slide it into the motor. Adjust the height of both shaft collars until the gears are at the same height and mesh well then tightened the shaft collars.
If you have difficulties putting the aluminum flash into the slots then use the drill to make two whole in each corner of the sail holder. Then mount the 6mm long machine screws to hold the sail. </p>

<p>• Step nine: slide a shaft collar, sail holder, and another shaft collar. Pull the lower shaft collar up so it’s not resting on the top of the base and secure it to the rod with its set screw. Then pinch the plastic sail holder with the shaft collar on top of it, and secure the assembly with a set screw. </p>

<p>Cut out three sails for your wind turbine to catch the wind. Then fit the sail in between the two sail holder.  </p>

<p>Do the same shaft collars, sail holder, shaft collar assembly on the top of the sail to finish the top of the wind turbine? It should spin with very little friction when you turn it by hand with the aluminum rod.</p>

<pre><code>Electronics
</code></pre>

<p>• First you need to create a circuit. Use the eight diodes and jumper wires to create this circuit on your breadboard as shown. It will tell any electricity generated in each coil of the motor to go to the same place: the power column on the bottom of the breadboard. Make sure all your diodes are facing the right direction, and don’t forget to jump the ground columns across the board.  </p>

<p>• Notice the LED in the center and the two capacitors at the sides of the board. Plug the long leg of your LED and capacitors into the power column and the short one into ground. Before you add the capacitors, give the wind lantern a spin and watch the LED flicker!</p>

<p>• The negative marked side should go to ground, the other to power. The capacitor will store energy while the wind lantern is creating it, and release it when it is not. The resulting effect here is a smoother flicker on the LED. Try adding more LEDs and more capacitors until you get a smooth glow when you spin the aluminum rod. You can also place diffuser paper over the side of the lantern to create a pleasing glow.</p>
