{"google":"","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to Wind Turbine \r\n\r\nThe Wind Turbine basically operates as, the wind turbine spin and catches wind energy which led the rod and the two gears to spin. As the gear moves, it gives motion to the motor which light up the LED. The circuit board has 8 diodes which only allow the electrons to flow in one direction and create a full rectification and allow the LED (Light-Emitting diodes) to light up. The two capacitors allow AC (alternating current) to be transfers into DC (direct currents) and to store energy. Motor is connected to the circuit board by four different wires soldered to a male header pin.\r\n\r\n\r\nI choose this project because renewable energy sources, such as: wind, solar energy, geothermal power and biomass crops, are necessary to eliminate our dependency on fossil fuels and to prevent extreme global change. In addition, solar collectors capture power only when the sun shines, but wind power is available 24 hours a day; therefore, I choose to use wind energy and build a vertical turbine that can light up a LED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild of Materials\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic Parts: \r\n1.

Use sand paper on the inside and outside of the end of the rod to smooth it and avoid cutting yourself. \r\n\r\n•\tStep three: Begin assembling the base. First start with the bottom disk, the hex standoffs, and the ¼ -20 screws, lock washers, and washers. Hold one hex standoff and place a washer then place the disk, another washer then a lock washer and finally put in the hex screw and tightened it with the hex key. Follow the same step to install all three of the hex standoffs. \r\n\r\n•\tStep four: Next place the flanged sleeve bearing, thrust washer, thrust bearing, another washer, and shaft collar on the center of the bottom disk. Next Slide the aluminum rod through the ½ shaft collar, thrust washer, bearing, washer stack. \r\n\r\n•\tStep five: Take the gear with bigger hole and apply glue to the ½ shaft collar and the gear to hold together. Next do the same with other gear but use the 5mm shaft collar instead of the ½ shaft collar. Wait 10 minutes to let it dry. \r\n•\tStep six: slide the ½ shaft collar with the gear and for now put aside the other gear. Next, slide another shaft collar and rest a sleeve bearing.\r\n\r\n•\tStep seven: Now remove the screws that hold the motor together. Use the longer M3 screws to mount the motor from the back, on the underside of the top disk. Next slide the top disk into the rod and repeat step three. \r\n\r\n•\tStep eight: slide the other gear from step five and slide it into the motor. Adjust the height of both shaft collars until the gears are at the same height and mesh well then tightened the shaft collars.\r\nIf you have difficulties putting the aluminum flash into the slots then use the drill to make two whole in each corner of the sail holder. Then mount the 6mm long machine screws to hold the sail. \r\n  \r\n•\tStep nine: slide a shaft collar, sail holder, and another shaft collar. Pull the lower shaft collar up so it’s not resting on the top of the base and secure it to the rod with its set screw. Then pinch the plastic sail holder with the shaft collar on top of it, and secure the assembly with a set screw. \r\n\r\nCut out three sails for your wind turbine to catch the wind. Then fit the sail in between the two sail holder.  \r\n\r\nDo the same shaft collars, sail holder, shaft collar assembly on the top of the sail to finish the top of the wind turbine? It should spin with very little friction when you turn it by hand with the aluminum rod.\r\n       \r\n    Electronics\r\n•\tFirst you need to create a circuit. Use the eight diodes and jumper wires to create this circuit on your breadboard as shown. It will tell any electricity generated in each coil of the motor to go to the same place: the power column on the bottom of the breadboard. Make sure all your diodes are facing the right direction, and don’t forget to jump the ground columns across the board.  \r\n\r\n•\tNotice the LED in the center and the two capacitors at the sides of the board. Plug the long leg of your LED and capacitors into the power column and the short one into ground. Before you add the capacitors, give the wind lantern a spin and watch the LED flicker!\r\n\r\n•\tThe negative marked side should go to ground, the other to power. The capacitor will store energy while the wind lantern is creating it, and release it when it is not. The resulting effect here is a smoother flicker on the LED. Try adding more LEDs and more capacitors until you get a smooth glow when you spin the aluminum rod. You can also place diffuser paper over the side of the lantern to create a pleasing glow.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\n     1.
